# RISC-V-CPU-Forge
A Verilog-based RISC-V CPU implementation. This project includes a sequential instruction fetcher, decoder, and ALU for the RV64IM architecture, culminating in a fully functional CPU with support for I/O operations, system calls, and memory management. Part of the CSE502 university course project.
